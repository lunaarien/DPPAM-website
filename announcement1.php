                    <p>The Diocese of Kalookan Public and Political Affairs Ministry (PPAM) - Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) 
                        recently conducted a courtesy call with the Election Officers of Caloocan City’s three districts to strengthen collaboration 
                        ahead of the 2025 elections. The meeting took place at the Office of the Election Officer in District 2 and was attended by 
                        key COMELEC officials: Atty. Ma. Anne D. Gonzales (District 1), Atty. Dinah A. Valencia-Jimenez (District 2), and Atty. Kevin V. Tibay 
                        (District 3).</p> 
                        
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Representing DPPAM-PPCRV were Bro. Angelito Bautista Jr. (Diocesan Coordinator), Bro. Danny Cabrera (District 2 City Coordinator), 
                        Jonathan De Vera (District 2 Assistant City Coordinator), Bro. Benjie Benjamin (District 1 City Coordinator), Sis. Danielle Jordan 
                        (Diocesan Secretary), and Bro. JC Moratalla (City District Secretary).</p> 
                        
                    <br>

                    <p>This collaboration reflects the ongoing partnership between the Diocese of Kalookan and COMELEC, with a shared commitment to promoting 
                        clean, honest, accountable, meaningful, and peaceful (CHAMP) elections. Both organizations remain dedicated to empowering voters, 
                        supporting volunteers, and safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process within the Diocese.</p>

                    <br>  

                    <p>The active participation of volunteers plays a crucial role in upholding democracy. Their commitment ensures that every vote is counted accurately, 
                    fostering trust in the electoral process and reinforcing the importance of free and fair elections.</p>  

                    <br>  

                    <p>According to PPCRV officials, more than 500,000 volunteers are expected to participate nationwide, covering thousands of polling precincts. 
                    These volunteers undergo specialized training in election monitoring, digital reporting, and conflict resolution. Their role is to act as the 
                    citizen’s watchdog, ensuring that elections remain transparent and credible.</p>  

                    <br>  

                    <p>In addition to on-ground monitoring, PPCRV is also enhancing its digital reporting system to allow volunteers to submit real-time data 
                    regarding voter turnout, potential irregularities, and other critical election-related updates. This will help authorities respond quickly 
                    to any concerns and ensure a smooth election process.</p>  

                    <br>  

                    <p>Beyond election day, volunteer efforts will continue in the post-election period. Teams will be deployed to verify election returns and 
                    assist in the transparency audit process, which helps confirm that all votes are properly recorded and counted. This post-election review 
                    process is a key safeguard against potential fraud and discrepancies.</p>  

                    <br>  

                    <p>As the nation prepares for this crucial democratic exercise, the dedication and vigilance of election volunteers stand as a testament to 
                    the power of civic engagement. Their efforts not only protect the integrity of the ballot but also strengthen public confidence in the 
                    electoral system. With the growing importance of volunteerism in elections, organizations like PPCRV continue to encourage citizens to take 
                    an active role in safeguarding democracy.</p>
