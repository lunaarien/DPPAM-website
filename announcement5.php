                    <p>OOn July 8, 2023, the Public & Political Affairs Ministry of the Diocese of Kalookan conducted the first session of the Voters' Education 
                        and Empowerment (VEE) Trainers' Training, equipping over 50 parish volunteers with the necessary knowledge and skills to lead voters' 
                        education initiatives in their respective parishes.

                    <p>The training is part of the Diocesan Public and Political Affairs Ministry (DPPAM) - Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) 
                        efforts to strengthen voter education and promote responsible electoral participation, particularly in preparation for the 2023 Barangay and 
                        Sangguniang Kabataan Elections.

                    <br>  

                    <p>Participants underwent discussions on electoral processes, voter rights and responsibilities, and community engagement strategies to ensure that 
                        parish-led VEE programs effectively guide voters in making informed decisions. By empowering local volunteers, the Diocese of Kalookan aims to 
                        foster a culture of active and responsible citizenship, reinforcing its commitment to fair, transparent, and participatory elections.</p>  

                    <br>  

                    <p>The initiative underscores the Diocese’s dedication to upholding democratic values and ensuring that parish communities play an active role in 
                        nation-building through voter awareness and empowerment.</p>  

                    <br>  

                    <p>The training also emphasized the importance of combating misinformation and promoting ethical voting practices within communities. With this initiative, 
                        the Diocese of Kalookan continues to empower faith-driven leaders in guiding voters toward a more informed and responsible electorate.</p>
