                    <p>With the 2025 National and Local Elections just around the corner, DPPAM has successfully conducted an orientation session for volunteers who will 
                        play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth and fair election process. The orientation was attended by both new and returning volunteers eager to contribute 
                        their time and skills to support the democratic process.

                    <br>  

                    <p>The event provided a comprehensive overview of the various responsibilities volunteers will undertake, including voter education, precinct monitoring, 
                        and logistical support. Volunteers were briefed on the importance of their roles in maintaining the integrity of the election, ensuring transparency, 
                        and promoting voter participation. Detailed training was also provided on how to effectively assist voters and manage election-day tasks to ensure 
                        everything runs smoothly.

                    <br>

                    <p>A key highlight of the session was the introduction of digital tools and resources that volunteers will use on election day, including mobile apps for 
                        real-time reporting and QR code-based attendance tracking. Volunteers also had the chance to meet their fellow team members and ask questions, fostering 
                        a sense of community and collaboration.</p>  

                    <br>  

                    <p>“We are deeply grateful to all the volunteers who have committed to helping make this election fair, transparent, and accessible to all citizens,” said a 
                        DPPAM spokesperson. “Their dedication is critical in ensuring that every voter has the support they need and that the election process is carried out 
                        with integrity.”</p>  

                    <br>  

                    <p>As Election Day approaches, DPPAM volunteers are ready to step into action, ensuring that the 2025 elections are a success, and that every voice is heard. 
                        The team is now fully trained and prepared to assist in making the upcoming elections as seamless and inclusive as possible.</p>
